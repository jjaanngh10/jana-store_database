And I used inquiries in my project to verify it and 
each of them to help me inquire about something

1 SELECT orders.order_id 
FROM orders 
WHERE user_id = 4;
This query retrieves all order IDs that belong to a specific user.
In this case, it shows all orders made by the user with user_id = 4.
It is useful for tracking customer orders and viewing a user’s purchase history.

2 SELECT * FROM products;
This query displays all records from the products table
It shows complete information about each product including product name price
 
3 SELECT product_name, stock FROM products WHERE stock < 20;
 This query retrieves products that have a stock quantity lower than 20.
It helps identify low-stock items so they can be restocked on time.
